# Talent Resolution Agent (TRA) - Executive Summary

## The Problem
Talent acquisition teams drown in fragmented, conflicting candidate data scattered across GitHub, ArXiv, patents, resumes, CRMs, PDFs, and social media. This chaos leads to missed opportunities, duplicate outreach, and poor candidate experience. Current solutions are siloed, lack identity resolution, and provide no unified view of candidate potential.

## The Solution
TRA is a multi-agent AI system that transforms messy candidate data into actionable intelligence through intelligent ingestion, validation, entity resolution, and automated action planning. Our system produces a calibrated "Extraordinary Index" that quantifies true talent potential across Innovation, Adoption, Influence, Velocity, and Selectivity dimensions.

## How It Works
**Multi-Agent Orchestration Flow:**
1. **Ingestion Agents** - Scrape, OCR, and normalize data from 15+ sources with PII redaction
2. **Extraction Agents** - Use LLM-powered JSON schema validation + regex/unit tests for data quality
3. **Resolution Engine** - pgvector + fuzzy matching + LLM adjudicator creates unified candidate profiles
4. **Contradiction Engine** - Detects and quantifies data conflicts with confidence scoring
5. **Extraordinary Index Calculator** - Synthesizes multi-dimensional talent metrics into single score
6. **Action Planner** - Generates CRM upserts, personalized outreach drafts, and evidence packets
7. **Human Console** - Provides provenance tracking, approve/override controls, and uncertainty handling

## Key Differentiators
- **Unified Identity Resolution**: First system to truly resolve candidate identities across disparate data sources
- **Contradiction Intelligence**: Quantifies and explains data conflicts rather than ignoring them
- **Calibrated Scoring**: Extraordinary Index provides objective, comparable talent assessment
- **Actionable Outputs**: Goes beyond analysis to generate ready-to-use CRM updates and outreach
- **Audit Trail**: Complete provenance tracking for compliance and continuous improvement

## Why TRA Wins
TRA addresses the fundamental problem of data fragmentation in talent acquisition with a technically sophisticated yet practical solution. Our multi-agent architecture ensures scalability and reliability, while the human-in-the-loop design maintains quality control. The Extraordinary Index provides a defensible, objective measure of talent that transforms subjective hiring into data-driven decisions. We don't just aggregate dataâ€”we resolve identities, detect contradictions, and take meaningful action.

**Technical Credibility**: Built on proven technologies (FastAPI, pgvector, LLM orchestration) with clear extension points for enterprise integration.

**Market Readiness**: Immediate value for talent teams while providing foundation for advanced features like O-1 visa evidence generation and automated interview scheduling.
