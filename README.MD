Introducing Extraordinary Recall, the world’s first AI-native social memory assistant:
Glasses (built on MentraOS) recognize a face or scan a badge.


An AI Recall Agent whispers their name and your last conversation notes.


A Deep Research Agent (powered by Extraordinary.com–style pipelines) builds a profile of why this person or company is extraordinary — citing awards, press, patents, and recognitions.


All privacy-first: embeddings run locally, and users control what’s saved or forgotten.”
